Han Solo and Princess Leia prepared for the birth of their child before the Battle of Jakku. Solo hired a nanny droid named T-2LC and bought Leia jogan fruits, though she reminded him not to overdo it. They were contacted by Norra Wexley, who planned to hunt down Grand Admiral Rae Sloane on Jakku. They learned that most of the Empire had retreated to Jakku, and Sinjir and Temmin returned to Chandrila to warn Princess Leia and Han Solo. They convinced Solo to let them borrow the Millennium Falcon, but were stopped by Senate Guards sent by Senator Tolwar Wartol, who had secretly placed a listening device in T-2LC. Han and Leia discovered the bug, removed it, and gave it to Chancellor Mon Mothma. Han and his team investigated senators who opposed Mothma's resolution, and with their help, the resolution passed. Solo and his team saved Conder and the senators' hostages and helped secure the New Republic's victory in the Battle of Jakku. Han and Leia attended peace talks, during which Leia gave birth to their son, Ben Solo. Han promised to be a good father and keep them on the right path. Han learned he could never have the same connection with the Force as Leia, but she told him fathers have their own special connection with their children.
