Later, Han Solo assisted the Rebellion in stealing the Imperial Star Destroyer Harbinger as part of a mission to assist the people of Tureen VII. During the operation, he raced Leia Organa to decide who would be the captain of the stolen ship. As they raced, Task Force 99 infiltrated the Harbinger. He piloted the ship while the incursion took place, and later used a thermal detonator on the bridge so that he and Leia could escape. The two of the them, using breath masks, were able to board the Falcon and escape before the Harbinger crashed. Solo later rescued Leia from Skorii-Lei and gave her medical attention. He then dropped off Pash Davane back on Skorii-Lei. Days later, he refused to go rescue C-3PO from SCAR Squadron, though R2-D2 went anyway. R2 managed to rescue C-3PO on his own, and when Darth Vader was pursuing R2, Han saved them in the Falcon. Later, on Horox III, Han and crew found dozens of rebels killed and burned. After wondering who did it, they found that it was SCAR Squadron. Luke convinced them to bury the bodies, and they did so with great sadness.
