Han Solo, along with his co-pilot Chewbacca, took on various smuggling jobs in order to pay off their debt to Jabba. However, Solo became increasingly hesitant and started turning down jobs. One day, Solo encountered a woman he had seen before and grew suspicious when she and her partner approached him. They revealed themselves to be agents of the Rebel Alliance and explained that Princess Leia wanted to borrow the Millennium Falcon for a special mission. Solo initially refused to let his ship be used without him, but eventually agreed to accompany Leia and the agents back to the Rebel fleet. There, he confronted Leia about her decision and learned that they wanted to use the Dragon Void Run as a cover to rescue undercover agents. Solo agreed to participate in the mission and, along with Chewbacca, joined the race. Throughout the race, Solo faced numerous challenges, including attacks on his ship and dealing with a potential traitor among the Rebel spies. In the end, he successfully completed the race and delivered his passengers back to the Rebel base. Solo decided to stay with the Rebels for a while longer after reflecting on the lessons he had learned.
