Han Solo accompanied Admiral Ackbar, Skywalker, and Leia to Mon Cala, where they met with Grand Admiral Urtya to request the Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet's assistance in the Rebel Alliance. However, they were attacked by a patrol transport, which Solo managed to bribe and destroy with a detonator. Despite their efforts, Urtya refused to join the Alliance, so Solo returned Leia and Ackbar to the Mako-Ta Space Docks. Later, Solo, Skywalker, Chewie, and Leia embarked on a mission to Dex Acquisitions Depot on Meor Ain. They infiltrated the ultra-security brig and liberated the Clawdite Tunga Arpagion. With Tunga's help, they planned to free King Lee-Char by posing him as Moff Tan Hubi. After a series of encounters and a daring rescue, Solo and his team were able to gather Lee-Char's final words and escape. On Mon Cala, Solo handed Lee-Char's recording to Urtya but had a change of heart when Leia was stunned. Solo allowed Urtya to take the recording and escaped Mon Cala with the Falcon, joined by the Mercantile fleet and Rebel Alliance fleet under Ackbar's command. During their escape, Solo defended the fleet from Empire bombers and TIE fighters, ensuring the safety of the Mon Calamari escape pods. With the help of the Rebel Alliance fleet and the Mercantile fleet, the Falcon jumped into hyperspace and successfully escaped. Solo then left Tunga at the Cosmatanic Steppes.
