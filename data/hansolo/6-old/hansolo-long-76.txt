In 31 ABY Solo traveled to Maz's castle, where he spoke with Kanata about Chewbacca being unable to do a job with him. Gannis Ducain, who worked for Kanata, overheard and suggested he help on the job. The job was to deliver cargo to Christophsis. When Han and Ducain arrived, Han left Ducain to guard the Millennium Falcon whilst he met with his contact. Ducain, however, stole Falcon. Ducain became a rich gunrunner. One day the Irving Boys stole the Falcon from him.\n\nAfter losing the Falcon, Han and Chewbacca obtained a Baleen-class heavy freighter named the Eravana that they used for their smuggling operations and even assembled a crew to assist them. Han spent the majority of his free time trying to track down the Falcon.
