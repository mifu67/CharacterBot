Han Solo was born on the planet Corellia in 32 BBY during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. He grew up in a favela and his father worked in the shipyards, building ships that Han dreamed of flying. However, his father eventually abandoned him. Around 24 BBY, Han joined the White Worms criminal gang and met a fellow member named Qi'ra. Despite being in service to the gang, Han showed defiance towards their methods. He intervened when a child was attacked, even though he gained nothing from it. Eventually, Han and Qi'ra were hunted down by various factions, including the White Worms, the Kaldana Syndicate, and the Empire. They had to partner up and find a resolution to their problems. Qi'ra eventually became the Head of the White Worms with Han's recommendation, and they began a romantic relationship.
