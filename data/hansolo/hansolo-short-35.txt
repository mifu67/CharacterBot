In 31 ABY, Han Solo and Chewbacca discovered their old ship, the Millennium Falcon, floating in space near Jakku. They found two stowaways, Rey and Finn, who were trying to deliver a droid named BB-8 to the Resistance. Han and Chewie agreed to help them. Han also rediscovered the Smuggler's Guide, previously owned by Unkar Plutt, which he considered a bad omen. The group was then attacked by the Guavian Death Gang and Kanjiklub, criminal organizations Han owed money to. Han left Rey and Finn in the lower corridors of the ship while he and Chewie confronted the criminals. However, the criminals recognized BB-8 and demanded that Han hand over the droid and any stowaways. Before a firefight broke out, Rey accidentally released the Rathtars, providing a distraction for the group to escape in the Falcon.
