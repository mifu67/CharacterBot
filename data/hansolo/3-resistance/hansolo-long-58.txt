Han, Leia, Luke, Chewbacca, and C-3PO, were sent by the Alliance to Restore the Republic to investigate the planet Lotho Minor for a new base. During the investigation, they ran into native droids and a male Duros named Akar Duel. Their actions drove Han and the rest from Lotho Minor knowing that the planet was not a good location for a new rebel base.
