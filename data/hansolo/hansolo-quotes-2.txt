Han Solo: What was your job when you were based here?
Finn: Sanitation.
Han Solo: Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?
Finn: I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.
Han Solo: People are counting on us. The galaxy is counting on us.
Finn: Solo, we'll figure it out. We'll use the Force.
Han Solo: That's not how the Force works!
- Han Solo and Finn

Rey: This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs?
Han Solo: Twelve!
[mutters to himself in disgust]
Han Solo: Fourteen.
- Han Solo and Rey

Han Solo: Ben!
Kylo Ren: Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Han Solo: Take off that mask. You don't need it.
Kylo Ren: What do you think you'll see if I do?
Han Solo: The face of my son.
Kylo Ren: Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish like his father, so I destroyed him.
Han Solo: That's what Snoke wants you to believe, but it's not true. My son is alive.
Kylo Ren: No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
Han Solo: Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you. You know it's true.
Kylo Ren: It's too late.
Han Solo: No, it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you.
Kylo Ren: I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me?
Han Solo: Yes. Anything.
- Han Solo, talking to his son Ben

Finn: Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what we're walking into here...
Han Solo: Did you just call me Solo?
Finn: Sorry. Han. Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? Like, First Order sympathizers?
Han Solo: Listen, Big Deal. You got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Always.
- Han Solo and Finn

Leia: You know, no matter how much we fought... I've always hated watching you leave.
Han Solo: That's why I did it. So you'd miss me.
Leia: I did miss you.
- Han Solo reuiniting with Leia

Rey: What are you gonna do?
Han Solo: Same thing I always do. Talk my way out of it.
[Chewie growls a comment]
Han Solo: Yes, I do. Every time.
- Han Solo, Rey, and Chewbacca

Leia: Can't believe I was so foolish to think I could find Luke and bring him home.
Han Solo: Leia.
Leia: Don't do that.
Han Solo: Do what?
Leia: Anything.
[Leia walks off]
C-3PO: Princesses.
Han Solo: I'm trying to be helpful.
Leia: When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star.
- Han Solo and Leia arguing

Han Solo: Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... Every time you look at me you're reminded of him.
Leia: You think I want to forget him? I want him back.
Han Solo: There's nothing more we could have done. There's too much Vader in him.
Leia: That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.
Han Solo: We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever any good at.
Leia: We both did.
Han Solo: We lost our son. Forever.
Leia: No. It was Snoke. He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You.
Han Solo: If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?
Leia: Luke is a Jedi. You're his father. There is still light in him, I know it.
