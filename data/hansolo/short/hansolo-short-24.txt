Han Solo, along with Chewbacca and C-3PO, went to the Ring of Kafrene to make a deal for a set of transponder codes with an Alaphani. After successfully concluding the deal, Solo and his companions were alerted to the presence of two bounty hunters from Jabba the Hutt. They managed to outsmart the bounty hunters and escape back to the Millennium Falcon. Solo then revealed that he had a contact who would pay them for the codes. Upon arriving at the Mako-Ta Space Docks, Solo discovered that the Rebel fleet was under attack by the Empire's Death Squadron. Despite the danger, Solo flew the Falcon towards one of the cruisers to help the Rebel fleet. He evaded an attack by Lord Vader and sent C-3PO in an escape pod to deliver a message to Leia. Solo later joined Skywalker's Rogue Squadron in taking out TIE fighters and fought alongside Skywalker to rescue Leia and the other ambassadors. Following a series of events, Solo, Leia, Luke, Chewbacca, and C-3PO were sent by the Alliance to investigate Lotho Minor for a new rebel base, but ultimately decided against it.
