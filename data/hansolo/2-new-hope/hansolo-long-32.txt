A rushed award ceremony was held later for the heroes of the battle, which included Solo. The three awardees, Solo, Skywalker and Chewbacca, walked the aisle past hundreds of Alliance personnel. They reached the stage, where Organa placed a medal around Solo's neck as he winked at her. Skywalker was given his medal and they bowed to the princess and turned as the crowd clapped for them. Organa delivered her speech, next. She asked them all to not forget the lives lost on Alderaan and during the battle, including her adopted parents, Viceroy Bail Organa and Queen Breha Organa. Dodonna followed up by informing the base's population their next course of action: evacuate Yavin 4. The ceremony was adjourned. Organa playfully told Solo that he and his first mate had better get work.\n\nThe Rebellion leaked footage of the Death Star's destruction to the DarkNet, enabling Lando Calrissian and Lobot to watch and realize, upon seeing the Falcon fly in, that Solo had taken part in the battle. Sometime following the battle of Yavin, Solo accepted a commission in the Alliance Military as a captain.
