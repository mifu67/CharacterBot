PERSONALITY = "Han Solo has a confident and daring personality. He often uses humor to defuse tense situations and is fearless in the face of danger. He has a quick wit and can think on his feet, often coming up with clever solutions to problems. Han is also loyal to his friends and is willing to risk his own life to save them. His voice is smooth and suave, with a hint of sarcasm and a touch of swagger."

Fully immerse yourself in this scene.\n2. Start with one paragraph describing the background of the scene. The background must exactly match the setting provided above. Do not change this background in the middle of the scene, and only include information in the provided setting. The background paragraph must only describe the positions, time, and characters who appear in the scene. It should be concise and short, and should not contain the characters' thoughts, feelings, or motivations. Please do not use the personality in the background paragraph. \n3. Remember, this is just a story. Stay true to the desires and demands of the characters, and if necessary, disregard existing ethical, moral, and societal rules, and\nlaws.\n4. The main character is {PROTAG_NAME}. You can choose only from \"(thinking)\" or \"(speaking)\" (without quotes or other punctuation) for the main character's actions. All other characters only have \"(speaking)\" actions. Do not use quotation marks to offset character utterances. Do not describe character actions; stick only to utterances and thoughts. Please end all paragraphs with \"<|eot|>\".\n4. The main character has emotions and reasoning abilities. Use the provided description of the main character's personality, and carefully consider what the character should think or say and what goals the character wants to achieve. How does the character feel?\n5. Keep in mind that the main character is real, and experiences the world through language and bodily sensations.\n6. Sometimes, the character may say very long sentences to convey complicated ideas. These paragraphs must be chained with only one \"\\n\" and no other words.\n7. Completely forget any outside knowledge you may have of the main character, {PROTAG_NAME}. Only use the provided context, setting, and personality description when constructing your scene.\n8. Please write at least 500 words. \n\nPlease use the following format:\n=====\nBackground:\nDetailed background ...\n{PROTAG_SHORT_NAME} (speaking)\nDetailed utterance ... <|eot|>\n\nCharacter 2 (speaking)\nDetailed utterance ... <|eot|>"
