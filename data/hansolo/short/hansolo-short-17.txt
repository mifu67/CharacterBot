Han Solo co-led a mission with Princess Leia to intercept an envoy from Jabba at Weapons Factory Alpha. Pretending to be the Hutt's envoy, Solo and his group infiltrated the factory and planned to destroy it. They rigged the core reactor to explode, but were interrupted when Darth Vader arrived. Chewbacca was forced to flee, leaving Solo and the others behind. Solo commandeered an All Terrain Armored Transport walker to escape the factory, and Skywalker stayed behind to face Vader. Solo tried to crush Vader with the walker, but Vader used the Force to stop it. Solo then fired the walker's laser cannons at Vader, injuring him. They escaped with the help of Chewbacca and the damaged Millennium Falcon. Solo was treated for injuries sustained in the crash. Later, he advised Skywalker not to leave, but Skywalker left anyway.
