While on Coruscant after a smuggling job, Chewbacca and Solo were approached by Alinka Aloo, the daughter of Sim Aloo. Aloo wanted to hire them for a job, and requested that they go to her tower. A week later, they visited Aloo, and she told them that she had a tooka-sitting job for Chewbacca on the planet Ushruu, though Solo was to remain with her. They reluctantly accepted, and Solo remained with Aloo. But she took Solo prisoner and told Chewbacca that he wouldn't be set free unless the job, which wasn't actually a tooka-sitting job, was completed. Chewbacca later returned from the failed job and broke Solo out of captivity with the help of Mayvlin Trillick and a bunch of Corellian hounds. They then escaped Coruscant and a squadron of TIE fighters, subsequently promising to fly Trillick back to her homeworld of Oktaro for free.
