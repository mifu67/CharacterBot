Han was persuaded by Leia Organa and Chewbacca to aid the Rebellion by rescuing Lieutenant Caluan Ematt. Han and Chewbacca narrowly escaped an Imperial-class Star Destroyer and encountered a gang of bounty hunters. They sought help from Delia Leighton, who eventually agreed to assist them. The group then headed to a low-rent hotel where Ematt was located. However, they were followed by the bounty hunters who were also working with the Imperials. Han and his team were surrounded by stormtroopers in a hangar, but managed to escape with the help of Delia and her ship. While being pursued by TIE fighters, the Miss Fortune, Delia's ship, took damage, but Han decided to help fix it instead of running away. They were caught in the tractor beam of the Star Destroyer, but Han's actions caused the Empire to abandon their pursuit. Han returned to Corellia with Chewbacca before being captured by Moloch and brought to Proxima. They managed to escape while causing damage to Proxima's face.
