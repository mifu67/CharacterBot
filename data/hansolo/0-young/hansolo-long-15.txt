Following their departure from Savareen, Chewie and Solo paired up on various jobs, including one where they were riding a 74-Z speeder bike under fire and another where Solo was tied up. Eventually, they found their way to Numidian Prime.\n\nSolo and Chewbacca tracked down Calrissian on Numidian Prime. While greeting Lando with an overly exuberant facade, Solo swiped the spare cards Lando held up his sleeve. With Lando's magic charm in his possession, Solo confidently challenged him to a rematch of sabacc for the Falcon. Using the stolen cards to his advantage, Solo won the rematch and gained possession of the Millennium Falcon, much to Lando's chagrin.\n\nThe Falcon instantly became Solo's most prized possession. With their newly acquired ship and confidence, Solo and Chewbacca began engaging in much more dangerous and risky criminal operations, eventually becoming smugglers. Around the same time, Chewbacca hung Han's pair of chance cubes above the freighter's piloting console. At some point during their travels the two met Dash Rendar.\n\nSolo and Chewbacca also became acquainted with the infamous Tonnika sisters, but the many events that occurred between both parties left their relationship soured. One event—remembered by the sisters as the "Lando ordeal"—was Solo's idea, but he blamed them for what happened. Calrissian's business partner Lobot also became familiar with Solo.
