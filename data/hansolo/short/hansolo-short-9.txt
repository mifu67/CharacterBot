Han Solo engaged in various adventures and close calls as he navigated the galaxy with Chewbacca aboard the Millennium Falcon. Notably, Solo piloted the Falcon through an asteroid field and successfully carried out a mission to sell marked sabacc decks to the casino on Marquinn. While Chewbacca took a day off, Solo encountered criminals Vullen Candroon and Zefin Tuzo, who were after Chewbacca. Han and Chewbacca successfully escaped with the help of the Millennium Falcon. They also eluded capture by Imperial Security Bureau agent Alexsandr Kallus and bounty hunter IG-88. On the planet Odona, Solo and Chewbacca had a brief encounter with Frax, whom they left behind. Later, Solo orchestrated a plan to extract revenge on a crime lord on Stenness, but double-crossed his partner Sana Starros, causing her to develop a negative opinion of him. Ultimately, Solo and Chewbacca crash-landed on a planet in the Monsua Nebula, where they discovered a secret hiding place in a cave.
