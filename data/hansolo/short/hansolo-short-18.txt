Han Solo asked Princess Leia for the parts he needed to repair the Millennium Falcon, but Leia refused to give them to him for free. She proposed that Solo act as her pilot on a scouting mission to find a new Rebel base, and in return, he would receive the parts he needed. Solo reluctantly agreed. They set off on the mission in a stolen Imperial shuttle, but were soon intercepted by TIE fighters. Solo tried to evade them, but Leia stopped him and transferred their stolen clearance codes to the TIE fighters. However, Solo's impatience caused him to alert the Imperials, leading to a firefight. Leia was furious with Solo, but they managed to escape to an unknown planet in the Monsua Nebula. There, they were confronted by Sana Starros, who claimed to be Solo's wife. Starros captured Leia to claim the bounty on her, but Solo and Leia managed to escape with the help of Chewbacca and C-3PO. They later rescued Luke Skywalker from Grakkus the Hutt's palace, and Solo decided to stay with the Rebellion a bit longer.
