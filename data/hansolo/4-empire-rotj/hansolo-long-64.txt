Following the battle, Solo, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 were sent by Organa to General Syndulla's camp to obtain food rations for the Ewoks as a means to keep the furry creatures from making a meal out of the captured stormtroopers. While at Syndulla's camp, Syndulla forced Solo to admit that her ship the Ghost was superior to the Falcon in order to get the rations.\n\nThe morning after the Battle of Endor, Solo led the Pathfinders on an assault on an Imperial outpost on the far side of Endor. Knowing that the Imperial outpost was preparing for a counterattack, the rebel commanders dispatched Han Solo on a mission to destroy the base. Han outlined a plan for the Pathfinders and their Ewok allies to strike the outpost with limited air cover. During the assault, the rebel pilot Lieutenant Shara Bey served as the transport's pilot. The Pathfinders quickly wiped out the garrison, and Solo uncovered a lot of data in the outpost's computers, which led him to conclude that the war was not over.\n\nTwo days after the Battle of Endor, Solo proposed to Organa, who accepted the marriage proposal. While in the Bright Tree Village, Han and Leia were then married; their ceremony was attended by only people they trusted. Solo and Organa departed Endor to have their honeymoon on the luxury Star Cruiser known as the Halcyon, where they encountered an Imperial force. She also told him she had met Qi'ra, much to his surprise. As a wedding gift to his wife, Solo reconfigured some of the crew quarters on the Falcon to include a galley.
