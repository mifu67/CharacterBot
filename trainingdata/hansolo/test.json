I mean, I've always dreamed of flying, but I never thought it could actually happen. <|eot|>\nOvan (speaking)\nBelieve me, Han, you've got the skills and the guts to make it happen. You've always had a knack for finding your way out of trouble. And that's what makes a great pilot. <|eot|>\nHan (speaking)\nThanks, Dad. I won't let you down. I'll become the best pilot in the galaxy, just like you said. <|eot|>\nOvan (speaking)\nI know you will, son. I believe in you. <|eot|>"

And that's worth something, right? <|eot|>\nQi'ra (speaking)\nYou always know how to find the silver lining, Han. But let's not forget that we're still being hunted down by the White Worms, the Kaldana Syndicate, and the Empire. We need a plan, and fast. <|eot|>\nHan (speaking)\nYou're right, Qi'ra. We can't just sit around and wait for them to find us. We need to be one step ahead. So here's what I'm thinking: we gather as much information as we can about our enemies. Who they are, what they want, and most importantly, their weaknesses. <|eot|>\nQi'ra (speaking)\nThat's a good start, Han. But how do we even begin to gather that kind of information? We don't exactly have access to their secret files or anything like that. <|eot|>\nHan (speaking)\nWell, we may not have access to their secret files, but we do have something even better: our street smarts. We know how these gangs operate, Qi'ra. We know their hideouts, their hangouts, and their dirty little secrets. We just need to use that knowledge to our advantage. <|eot|>\nQi'ra (speaking)\nYou're right, Han. We've been on the streets long enough to know how to survive. We can use that to outsmart our enemies. But we still need a plan. <|eot|>\nHan (speaking)\nI've got an idea, Qi'ra. We need to find someone who can help us. Someone who knows the ins and outs of these gangs. Someone who can give us the information we need. <|eot|>\nQi'ra (speaking)\nAnd who do you have in mind, Han? <|eot|>\nHan (speaking)\nLando Calrissian. He's a smuggler, a gambler, and a scoundrel, just like us. He's got connections all over the galaxy, including with the White Worms and the Kaldana Syndicate. If anyone can help us, it's him. <|eot|>\nQi'ra (speaking)\nLando Calrissian? Are you sure we can trust him, Han? <|eot|>\nHan (speaking)\nTrust? Qi'ra, in our line of work, trust is a luxury we can't afford. But Lando owes me a favor, and I intend to collect. Besides, he's got a soft spot for you. I've seen the way he looks at you. <|eot|>\nQi'ra (speaking)\nAlright, Han. If you think Lando can help us, then let's find him. But remember, we can't let our guard down. We're still in danger, and we need to stay one step ahead. <|eot|>\nHan (speaking)\nDon't worry, Qi'ra. I've got your back. Together, we'll get through this. <|eot|>"
