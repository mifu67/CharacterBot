Han Solo and Chewbacca became employed by the crime lord Jabba the Hutt and smuggled for him on the planet Tatooine. They dropped a cargo to escape an Imperial blockade and landed on a planet inhabited by crime lord Rekias Nodo. They posed as Jabba to trick Nodo into repairing their ship, but were interrupted by another crime boss, Lallani. A shootout ensued, and Solo and Chewbacca used the chaos to escape. They freed the prisoners and stole rhydonium, but Chewbacca convinced Solo to give it to the freed prisoners. Solo was later captured by bounty hunters but was rescued by Chewbacca. They encountered droids on a planet that wanted to eradicate all life but managed to escape. Chewbacca and Solo were then hired by Alinka Aloo, who turned out to be a captor. They escaped and promised to fly Mayvlin Trillick to her homeworld. They later took a mission to free planet Rendel from a curse, encountered a treasure hunt, and escaped with the Millennium Falcon. On the planet Ogem, Makkeer betrayed Solo, but Solo and Chewbacca outsmarted Gwarm and his gang and escaped with Rane Mahal.
