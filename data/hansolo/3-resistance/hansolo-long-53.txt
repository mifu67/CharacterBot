Solo took Leia to Odona to see if it was a viable location for a new rebel base. However, they got lost in a series of caves for three days and were attacked by a creature. Unbeknownst to Solo or Leia, they were tracked and followed by Frax, Selt, and a droid. Solo came under fire and took Leia to cover. He then told Leia to get to the Falcon. Solo returned to the caves and was confronted by Frax, who wanted revenge against Solo for dropping him into the Cordaxian Sea to be captured by the Empire. Solo tried to run, but was stopped by Frax and bounty hunters. However, Leia was able to light the droid on fire and escape Frax.\n\nAs Solo and Leia made their way back to the Falcon, they were confronted by Frax, who attempted to shoot him despite Leia's threat to shoot him. Despite missing Frax, Leia was able to cause ice to come at him and freeze him to death. Solo and Leia were found by Chewie and taken to the Rebel fleet to recover.
