While serving as a swamp trooper in an infantry during a battle on Mimban, he encounters a gang of criminals posing as Imperial soldiers led by Tobias Beckett. He tries to blackmail them into taking him with them, but Beckett has him arrested for desertion and thrown into a pit to be executed by a Wookiee outcast, Chewbacca.
