From the captain's seat of the Millennium Falcon, Solo led the defense of the Rebel fleet from an attack by Imperial forces, buying time for the fleet to jump to Baraan-Fa. Shortly after, he accompanied Wedge Antilles, Leia, Luke, and Chewbacca on a mission to Crait, which the Alliance was considering as a location for its hidden base of operations. There they met Trusk Berinato, an old ally of Bail Organa who Leia thought would help the Alliance. Instead Trusk had forged environmental reports and summoned SCAR Squadron to eliminate the Rebels. Solo attempted to evacuate Leia while Luke and Wedge engaged SCAR Squadron, but Trusk shot him in the shoulder. Leia returned fire, incapacitating Trusk as the Rebels regrouped and left the system aboard the Millennium Falcon.
