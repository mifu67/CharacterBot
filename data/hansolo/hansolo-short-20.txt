Han Solo decided to cheat in a game of sabacc in order to try and double the Rebellion's credits. However, the Dowutin opponent suspected Solo of cheating. Solo and Luke Skywalker fled when they discovered that Solo was playing dishonestly. They boarded the Millennium Falcon and escaped the planet. Skywalker was angry with Solo for risking the Rebel credits. Solo revealed that he also had a bounty on his head from the Empire. The duo traveled to Nar Shaddaa where Skywalker acquired a smuggling job, but it only paid half of what Solo had hoped for. The cargo turned out to be a herd of nerfs, which caused problems on the Falcon. On their way to the planet Ibaar, they were chased by Imperial TIE fighters, but Skywalker successfully shot them down. They landed on Ibaar and unloaded the nerfs. Skywalker begged Solo to let him pilot the Falcon, but Solo refused and had him clean the ship instead. They received a distress message and went to Sunspot Prison to rendezvous with Princess Organa and Sana Starros. However, they were captured by Eneb Ray, but were freed when Organa, Starros, and Doctor Aphra arrested Ray.
