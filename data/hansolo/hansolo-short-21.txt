Han Solo assisted the Rebellion in stealing the Imperial Star Destroyer Harbinger as part of a mission to assist the people of Tureen VII. He piloted the ship while it was infiltrated by Task Force 99, and later used a thermal detonator on the bridge to escape with Leia Organa. Solo rescued Leia from Skorii-Lei and dropped off Pash Davane back on the planet. A few days later, he saved R2-D2 and C-3PO from SCAR Squadron and rescued them in the Falcon from Darth Vader. On Horox III, Solo and his crew discovered a rebel outpost burned and destroyed by SCAR Squadron. They buried the bodies with great sadness. Solo then traveled to Ktath'atn, where he was hypnotized and forced to serve the queen, but was eventually able to free the people from her control. He took Grakkus to Akiva and resumed his voyage after a failed attack. Solo also accompanied Leia to Odona to scout for a new rebel base. They were attacked by Frax but were able to escape with Chewbacca's help and recover on the Rebel fleet.
