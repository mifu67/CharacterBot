Around 9 ABY, during the search for Grand Admiral Thrawn, the former Jedi Knight and General turned mercenary Baylan Skoll had Solo's name written in a device on his gauntlet, as well as the names of other key members of the Heroes of Yavin.\n\nFinding himself husband of an important politician, Han passed the time by becoming a successful racing pilot. On one occasion he returned to Corellia to compete in The Gauntlet, where he raced against Greer Sonnel and offered her a spot on his team for the Five Sabers race.\n\nIn the years after the end of the Galactic Civil War, Solo became the owner of a shipping company and developed a reputation for being a vigilant and responsible owner. Outside of his work, Han often raced for charity and sponsored several piloting matches. Due to his work, Solo found himself traveling through different systems, working on ships.\n\nTheir son, Ben, proved to be Force-sensitive and was sent to be trained by his uncle Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force. Meanwhile, his wife Leia served as a prominent Senator in the Galactic Senate on Hosnian Prime, the capital of the New Republic. Han and his family lived separate lives but he kept in touch with his wife via hologram.
