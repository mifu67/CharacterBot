Han Solo, along with Leia and Luke Skywalker, went to Jedha where they met and rescued Chulco Gi and Ubin Des. They then escaped from Imperial forces and Solo took the Millennium Falcon to NaJedha so Leia could speak with Des about the surviving Partisans. Solo and the others were brought before Benthic, the leader of the Partisans, who decided to free them after Solo's bold statement. They then discussed the plan to destroy the Drill citadel. Solo and Leia flew the Falcon towards the drill and Solo successfully destroyed it. However, the Empire then deployed the Leviathan, a massive war machine that seemed indestructible. Solo, Leia, and Benthic attempted to find a way to destroy it but failed. Solo piloted an airspeeder with Leia as his gunner and rescued Des and her team from the Leviathan. Chewbacca arrived to assist them and together they made a plan to attack the Leviathan using the plans Chewie acquired. As the partisans boarded the Falcon, they came under attack and Benthic was wounded. Solo decided to let the partisans escape and held off the stormtroopers himself. Eventually, Solo and the partisans were able to make their way to the bridge and pilot the Leviathan into Jedha City's crater. They barricaded the bridge to prevent the Empire from stopping their plans. Solo and the partisans returned to the Falcon just in time and left Jedha. Han Solo later led the defense of the Rebel fleet from an Imperial attack and accompanied Leia, Luke, and Chewbacca on a mission to Crait. There, they encountered an old ally of Leia's father who betrayed them. Solo attempted to evacuate Leia while Luke and Wedge engaged the enemy, but Solo was shot in the shoulder. Leia retaliated, and they all escaped aboard the Millennium Falcon.
