Han Solo, along with C-3PO and the Pathfinders, participated in a raid on an ISB black site where they discovered the Empire's plan to execute Operation: Cinder. Han later arrived at Maz Kanata's castle to rendezvous with an Imperial defector, and together they fought their way back to the Millennium Falcon. Han and Chewbacca received intelligence about decreased Imperial presence on Kashyyyk, leading them to gather a group of smugglers to liberate the planet, only to find out that it was a trap set by the Empire. Han's team managed to rescue Chewbacca from Ashmead's Lock, with the help of Norra Wexley and her team. Han then stayed behind with Chewbacca, Jas Emari, Sinjir Rath Velus, and Jom Barell to liberate the Wookiees and disable the inhibitor chips on the planet. With the assistance of Leia and New Republic reinforcements, they successfully accomplished their mission. Han and Leia then left Kashyyyk, with intentions to return if Chewbacca ever needed their help.
