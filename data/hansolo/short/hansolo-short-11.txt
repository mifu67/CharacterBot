Han Solo and Chewbacca aided Khel Tanna and her crew with a heist on Galator III. They rescued the crew from local security and received payment from Jabba for their work. Jabba then assigned them to steal a verillix urn from Augustus Graves on Corellia. Solo, Chewbacca, and Greedo were joined by a man claiming to be Solo's father on the heist. However, they discovered that the safe in Graves' penthouse was empty. They tracked the urn to Madelin Sun on Antillion but found that it had been stolen and the supposed father was a conman. Solo and Chewbacca were left stranded on Escalan, and later found out that Chewbacca was imprisoned on Gulhadar. They managed to rescue Chewbacca and traveled to Tatooine to find Greedo for information on the Falcon's location. They reclaimed the Falcon and devised a plan to steal the urn from Tarkin's office on Coruscant. After successfully retrieving the urn, they realized it contained a neural core instead. Instead of giving it to Jabba, they decided to bury it instead.
