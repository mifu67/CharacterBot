In 31 ABY while transporting a cargo of three Rathtars aboard the Eravana for the King Prana, Han and Chewie found the Falcon floating in space near the desert planet of Jakku, pulling his prized vessel in with a tractor beam. Upon boarding their old vessel, the two went about inspecting their ship and found two stowaways, Jakku scavenger Rey and former First Order stormtrooper Finn, who he assumed were the thieves who had stolen the Falcon. When Rey and Finn explained that they were going to take a droid named BB-8 to the Resistance as he had a map to the location of Solo's old friend Luke Skywalker, Han and Chewie agreed to help them.\n\nSolo rediscovered the Smuggler's Guide that was previously owned by Unkar Plutt aboard the ship, thinking it was a bad omen that this thing keeps resurfacing. However, Chewbacca thought it was a good luck that it keeps coming back and was happy to see the logbook and kept opening different pages. Han thought if that was true his life would have turned out differently. These reflections were recorded in the logbook.
