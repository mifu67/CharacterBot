Nothing here... yet. But there will be!
Here's the process: 
Step 1: ask the user which character they'd like to talk to
Step 2: 
    - grab the personality and quotes page for the specified character
    - create our prompts and store them in specific message lists
    - output a welcome message and get the ball rolling
Step 3: chat, using LlamaIndex to get the relevant grounding text
    - model flow: question -> text retrieval -> character answer -> voice rewriting -> output
Step 4: profit
