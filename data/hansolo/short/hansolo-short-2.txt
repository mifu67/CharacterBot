Han enlisted in the Imperial academy on the planet Carida. Upon arrival, Han was stripped of his clothing and given a new Imperial cadet suit. He soon discovered that he was only known by a number at the academy and not his real name. Han faced challenges and bullying from fellow cadets, including a cadet named Beilert Valance who attacked him. However, Han showed bravery and defended himself. Han's actions in saving a fellow cadet's life earned him a chance to become a top pilot in the Galactic Empire. He completed his training and was stationed on the planet Qhulosk as part of Carida Squadron. During a battle, Han became determined to rescue Valance, who had been shot down by enemy fighters. Han and a group of cadets embarked on a risky mission to save Valance and succeeded. However, they were captured by the Qhuloskians but were ultimately saved by Ghulars. Han continued to face challenges and was eventually court-martialed for disobeying orders, leading to his expulsion from the academy. He was then drafted into the Imperial Armored Division and deployed to Mimban.
