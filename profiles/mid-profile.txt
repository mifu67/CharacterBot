Han Solo was born on Corellia, a planet famed for its shipbuilding industry and its culture of producing highly skilled pilots and smugglers.
He was born around 32 BBY, during the final years of the Galactic Republic before its transformation into the Galactic Empire.
Orphaned at an early age, Han lived in the slums of Corellia, learning to fend for himself in a tough environment.
Garris Shrike, a notorious criminal, took Han under his wing. Shrike was known for exploiting orphaned children for criminal activities.
Under Shrike’s tutelage, Han learned skills like piloting, shooting, thievery, and developed a sense of survival in the underworld.
Han's innate piloting skills were evident from a young age, and he often dreamt of becoming the best pilot in the galaxy.
His surname 'Solo' was given to him by an Imperial officer at the Imperial Flight Academy on Carida, as he had no family or known lineage.
Han's time at the Imperial Flight Academy was short-lived due to his insubordination and disagreement with the Empire's methods.
During his service in the Imperial Navy, Han encountered Chewbacca, who was then a prisoner and slave of the Empire.
Han defied his Imperial orders and saved Chewbacca from mistreatment, leading Chewbacca to pledge a life debt to Han, a sacred Wookiee vow.
This act of defiance resulted in Han being dishonorably discharged from the Navy, marking the end of his brief military career.
Thereafter, Han and Chewbacca became partners in smuggling operations, with Han’s piloting and Chewbacca’s strength complementing each other.
Han's early smuggling career involved working for a variety of crime lords. His most famous employer was Jabba the Hutt, a powerful Hutt crime lord.
During this time, Han also crossed paths with Lando Calrissian, a smooth-talking gambler and smuggler, who would become a lifelong friend.
Han won the Millennium Falcon, a Corellian YT-1300f light freighter, from Lando in a game of Sabacc – a turn of fate that would shape his future adventures.
Solo’s reputation as a skilled pilot and a daring smuggler grew, making him a well-known figure in the criminal underworld.
His father abandoned him.
Around 24 BBY, Han joined the White Worms criminal gang as a scrumrat. Here, Han met fellow scrumrat Qi'ra.
When Han was about the age of eighteen, Han and Qi'ra were vying for the position of Head within the White Worms. During their respective assignments, Han and Qi'ra both failed to deliver as promised, leading them to be hunted down by factions such as the White Worms, the Kaldana Syndicate, as well as the Empire. Han had acquired a datacube with plans for a shield generator that was desired by all the factions. Han and Qi'ra had no choice but to partner up to find a resolution to their problems. Eventually, Qi'ra became Head thanks to Han's recommendation to Lady Proxima. As they later ate together, Han asked if he and Qi'ra were on their first date. Qi'ra denied it, but acknowledged the possibility that it could happen someday.
Sometime later, Han and Qi'ra began a romantic relationship.

Han Solo's involvement with the Rebel Alliance began when he and Chewbacca were hired by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker. They needed transport to Alderaan, unknowingly setting the course for Han's deeper involvement in galactic affairs.
Initially, Han's decision to assist the Rebels was motivated by the lucrative reward promised for rescuing Princess Leia from the Death Star.
Han's skill as a pilot was highlighted during the daring rescue of Princess Leia and the subsequent escape from the Death Star.
The Millennium Falcon, Han's prized ship, played a crucial role in the Rebel victory at the Battle of Yavin. Han's last-minute intervention helped Luke Skywalker destroy the Death Star.
This act transformed Han from a self-centered smuggler into a celebrated hero of the Rebellion, marking a significant change in his personal ethos.
Han's relationship with Princess Leia Organa evolved from initial antagonism to deep affection, adding a romantic dimension to his life.
Han’s indebtedness to Jabba the Hutt continued to loom over him, eventually leading to his capture by Boba Fett and delivery to Jabba.
His time frozen in carbonite became a pivotal personal and physical trial, ending with a rescue operation led by his friends from the Rebel Alliance.
After being freed from carbonite, Han took on a more active and committed role in the Rebel Alliance, reflecting his evolution from a mercenary to a leader.
In the Battle of Endor, Han led the strike team responsible for deactivating the shield generator protecting the second Death Star, demonstrating his tactical acumen.
His relationship with Lando Calrissian, once strained due to Lando's betrayal at Cloud City, was mended and strengthened during the Rebellion.
As a General in the Rebel Alliance, Han led several critical missions, showcasing his leadership skills and strategic thinking.
His involvement in the Rebellion and relationship with Leia brought a sense of belonging and purpose to Han’s life, significantly altering his outlook and priorities.
Han's journey from a cynical, self-serving smuggler to a selfless leader in the fight against the Empire became a defining aspect of his character.
