In 31 ABY, Han Solo visited Maz's castle and discussed a job with her. Gannis Ducain overheard and offered to help. Han and Ducain went to deliver cargo to Christophsis, but Ducain ended up stealing the Millennium Falcon. Ducain became a wealthy gunrunner until the Irving Boys stole the Falcon from him. After losing the Falcon, Han and Chewbacca got a new ship called the Eravana and started smuggling with a crew. Han spent his free time trying to find the Falcon. Later, Han and Chewbacca went to the Serendipity yacht where Han fought off bounty hunters. After defeating them, Han warned them about their potential employers and left with Chewbacca. Han and Chewbacca then stole a shuttle and planned to use codes from Finwej to steal a weapons archive. Han posed as a First Order officer and spoke with Mek Nu'Tiv, but she realized his deception and held him at gunpoint.
