Han offered Rey a job as a second mate aboard his ship, the Millennium Falcon. Rey turned down the offer, but Han still took her and Finn to meet his friend Kanata. They were attacked by the First Order, but managed to escape with the help of the Resistance. Han's estranged wife, General Leia Organa, took them to the Resistance base. Han and Leia were aware that their son, Kylo Ren, had turned to the dark side, causing their separation. The Resistance planned an attack on Starkiller Base, and Han volunteered to disable the shield with Chewbacca. Han confronted Kylo Ren in an attempt to convince him to come back, but Kylo killed his father. Han's death was mourned by Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey. The star that Starkiller Base exploded into was named "Solo" in his honor.
