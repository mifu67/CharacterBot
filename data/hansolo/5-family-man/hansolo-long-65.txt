Before the formal establishment of the New Republic, Solo, C-3PO, and the Pathfinders participated in a raid on an ISB black site at the Wretch of Tayron. During the assault, the Pathfinders managed to down an AT-ST walker, which caused a breach in the facility's hall. This allowed Solo and his men to enter the base and secure the computers before the base commander could initiate a purge of the computers. With the aid of C-3PO, the Pathfinders were able to hack into the Imperial data files and discovered that the Empire had begun to execute Operation: Cinder, a posthumous order issued by the Emperor to devastate several worlds including Naboo as retribution for his demise. The Pathfinders' actions enabled the Rebel Alliance to deploy forces to halt Operation: Cinder, saving many lives and worlds.\n\nSeveral months after the Battle of Endor, Han arrived at Maz Kanata's castle on Takodana to rendezvous with an Imperial defector named Ralsius Paldora, who had stolen intelligence crucial to the liberation of Kashyyyk. The Empire had quickly discovered his treachery and followed him. Recovering the data cubes and fighting their way back to the Falcon, Han and Ralsius were saved by the arrival of Inferno Squad, buying them time to escape the planet.
