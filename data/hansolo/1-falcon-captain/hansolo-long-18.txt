While they were at the space port on Valtos in 9 BBY, Solo was loading supplies onto the Millennium Falcon when he was captured by the bounty hunters 4-LOM and Zuckuss. The duo informed Solo that Nodo had put a bounty on his head. Solo, however, was hired by Beris Ford's family to rescue him from the bounty hunters. Solo and Ford were freed by Chewbacca. After dumping Ford in a barrel with a homing beacon, Solo and Chewbacca were pursued by the Mist Hunter. Solo and Chewbacca were forced to crash the Falcon on a planet in its ocean; the two bounty hunters followed them.\n\nThe four scoundrels soon found that the planet was inhabited by a horde of droids that wanted to eradicate all life in the galaxy. The four escaped in the Falcon, but Han and Chewie tricked the bounty hunters into thinking that the Falcon lost power, and the two hunters fell for the trick, jumping back to the planet below. Han and Chewie then escaped the planet, leaving 4-LOM and Zuckuss behind.
