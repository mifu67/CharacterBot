Solo and Chewbacca stole a Xi-class light shuttle from the shipyard of the Fluzhi Clan. They escaped from the shipyard and planned to use codes from Finwej to steal a weapons archive from Mek Nu'Tiv. Solo hoped to use the archive to get several people they owed money to off their backs. Solo, posing as a First Order officer, boarded Mek Nu'Tiv's cruiser and spoke with her and her crew. Nu'Tiv, however, realized that Solo had used Finwej to get credits and had her crew hold him at gunpoint.
