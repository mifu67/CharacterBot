Han Solo and Princess Leia were informed that Darth Vader had been shot down on Vrogas Vas by Alliance forces. Solo decided to prioritize rescuing Luke Skywalker, who had crashed his X-wing into Vader's TIE Advanced, while Leia wanted to kill Vader. Solo and Chewbacca arrived on Vrogas Vas and began searching for Skywalker. They encountered Doctor Aphra and her droids, who had kidnapped Skywalker on Vader's orders. Solo and Chewbacca fought against Aphra and her droids, eventually rescuing Skywalker. They were then confronted by Triple-Zero and Beetee, who planned to kill them. Artoo intervened by causing Beetee to explode, allowing Solo and the group to escape. Back on the Millennium Falcon, Solo received a distress call from Leia, who was captured by Vader and ordered a squadron of bombers to kill them both. Before they could save her, the Falcon was hit by an Auzituck anti-slaver gunship, causing them to crash. Solo, Chewbacca, and Skywalker were then attacked by Krrsantan, who intended to take Skywalker to Aphra. Chewbacca and Solo fought against Krrsantan, while Skywalker escaped and Leia was captured. They managed to defeat Krrsantan, but Skywalker was captured by stormtroopers. After freeing Threepio from Triple-Zero, they discovered that Aphra had set a trap for them using micro-mines. Leia returned and saved them from Aphra, and they all escaped Vrogas Vas.
