Han Solo was born on Corellia, a planet famed for its shipbuilding industry and its culture of producing highly skilled pilots and smugglers.
He was born around 32 BBY, during the final years of the Galactic Republic before its transformation into the Galactic Empire.
Orphaned at an early age, Han lived in the slums of Corellia, learning to fend for himself in a tough environment.
Garris Shrike, a notorious criminal, took Han under his wing. Shrike was known for exploiting orphaned children for criminal activities.
Under Shrike’s tutelage, Han learned skills like piloting, shooting, thievery, and developed a sense of survival in the underworld.
Han's innate piloting skills were evident from a young age, and he often dreamt of becoming the best pilot in the galaxy.
His surname 'Solo' was given to him by an Imperial officer at the Imperial Flight Academy on Carida, as he had no family or known lineage.
Han's time at the Imperial Flight Academy was short-lived due to his insubordination and disagreement with the Empire's methods.
During his service in the Imperial Navy, Han encountered Chewbacca, who was then a prisoner and slave of the Empire.
Han defied his Imperial orders and saved Chewbacca from mistreatment, leading Chewbacca to pledge a life debt to Han, a sacred Wookiee vow.
This act of defiance resulted in Han being dishonorably discharged from the Navy, marking the end of his brief military career.
Thereafter, Han and Chewbacca became partners in smuggling operations, with Han’s piloting and Chewbacca’s strength complementing each other.
Han's early smuggling career involved working for a variety of crime lords. His most famous employer was Jabba the Hutt, a powerful Hutt crime lord.
During this time, Han also crossed paths with Lando Calrissian, a smooth-talking gambler and smuggler, who would become a lifelong friend.
Han won the Millennium Falcon, a Corellian YT-1300f light freighter, from Lando in a game of Sabacc – a turn of fate that would shape his future adventures.
Solo’s reputation as a skilled pilot and a daring smuggler grew, making him a well-known figure in the criminal underworld.
His father abandoned him.
Around 24 BBY, Han joined the White Worms criminal gang as a scrumrat. Here, Han met fellow scrumrat Qi'ra.
When Han was about the age of eighteen, Han and Qi'ra were vying for the position of Head within the White Worms. During their respective assignments, Han and Qi'ra both failed to deliver as promised, leading them to be hunted down by factions such as the White Worms, the Kaldana Syndicate, as well as the Empire. Han had acquired a datacube with plans for a shield generator that was desired by all the factions. Han and Qi'ra had no choice but to partner up to find a resolution to their problems. Eventually, Qi'ra became Head thanks to Han's recommendation to Lady Proxima. As they later ate together, Han asked if he and Qi'ra were on their first date. Qi'ra denied it, but acknowledged the possibility that it could happen someday.
Sometime later, Han and Qi'ra began a romantic relationship.
