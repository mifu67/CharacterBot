At the Horox III rebel outpost, Solo was told by S4 that Luke went with Dr. Aphra. Solo, along with Chewbacca, Starros, Leia, and S4 took the Falcon to the Citadel of Ktath'atn. Upon their arrival at Ktath'atn, Solo and the others met 0-0-0 and BT-1. They then met up with Skywalker and Aphra at the Ark Angel II. Sol told her that the Ark Angel's aft thruster was misaligned. He was then confronted by Varroa and several of the Queen's guards. Solo and the others then hid behind a door. Inside the door were Abersyn symbiotes. Solo attempted to confront the Queen but was hypnotized.\n\nSolo was taken to the queen's chamber, where one of the symbiotes stung him in the neck. He was then forced to drink something that forced him to serve the queen. Solo was given armor and forced to track down Leia and Starros. Solo and the guards cornered Leia. He attempted to use a symbiote on her but was stopped when Starros and Aphra's droids arrived. Solo attempted to shoot Leia and Starros, but Leia was able to convince him and the guards to lower their weapons. Varroa attempted to reassert the hive's control over him, but Solo called in Black Krrsantan. Solo was able to take control of the other guards and killed Varroa. Solo was named King by the guards, but did not want to tell people what to do. He was able to disband the hive and free the people. Solo was then sedated by Triple-Zero. Solo, Starros, Skywalker, and Leia left Ktath'atn knowing that it was freed.
